## Usage

First, make both shell scripts executable:

```
$ chmod +x compile.sh
$ chmod +x run.sh
```

Compile the C-code with the shell script `compile.sh`:

```
$ ./compile.sh
```

Run the program by executing the shell script `run.sh`:

```
$ ./run.sh
```

As soon as the program runs, you can make some tests by utilizing `netcat`. Open up another terminal and connect to the server. `netcat` is used as a TCP client for testing purposes.

```
$ nc 127.0.0.1 3490
```

After a successful connection it should show something similar to this in the terminal:

```
hello client
"
```

You may type some input characters and send them to the server after you hit return.
